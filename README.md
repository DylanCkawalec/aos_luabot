# Aos Hacker Death Match

the set up is easy, run through each command and prompt the admin when to register, and the command's in the terminal will execute with ease. 

Question: 
Go to the documentation on how to host your own server farm match making. Win tokens as a reward, or gameifi the grid, handlers and other coordinates of the map's. 

3D Terminal Maps are an execiting concept in terminal execution. The way we can now build a terminal game, is pretty remarkable. Not only can it be an engaging way of learning the terminal, but you have an easy experience loading in contract's that will behave autonomously. Aim-bots, bridge bots, health-bots, you name the token yourself. 

This repository originally tested to see if the grid, could lock constraints. 

Since the Operating system cannot flag itself, then it requires a smart layer interface where local storage can be garbage collected, or memmory efficient to clear RAM without cache, clutter. 

The Grid can express an instance of memory, but it's bound to runtime execution. 

### rust can be useful for lua bot smart contracts
- just can help solve this problem with memory contraints. If all bot's were to be interpreted by a serialization process, the terminal can execute commands hidden to the user. This is local execution, and rust comes with many terminal interface commands that can CRUD on the internet locally and still interface with mainnet effectively. 

### the OS can be supported by a software CPU, 
- uses the MIPS architecture to run GoLang, Solidity, or Assembly to execute constractual like agreements where there is a full proof of execution that is untracable to the client side execution. 

### Aleo can be a local testnet prover, and print encrypted record's on mainnet explorer's or on Arweave Storage. 
-- that title sort of expresses the entire thought. Yes, we can have a zero knowledge software CPU driving execution of programs local to the client compiling a proof of their operations (contract). this computation can create an output in a binary that can be ran by anyone, as long as they have the proof. The proving network can pass the encrypted Binary, after a local or decentralized sequencer has transition the data binary into JSON format, and into the slots by command line arguments.

# What's Cool About this

## 3D Terminal Maps

3D Terminal Maps introduce an exciting concept in terminal execution. The ability to build a terminal game is quite remarkable. It's not only an engaging way to learn the terminal, but it also provides an easy experience for loading contracts that will behave autonomously. You can create aim-bots, bridge bots, health-bots, and more.

This repository was originally created to test if the grid could lock constraints. Since the Operating System cannot flag itself, it requires a smart layer interface where local storage can be garbage collected or made memory efficient to clear RAM without cache clutter.

The Grid can represent an instance of memory, but it's bound to runtime execution.

## Rust and Lua Bot Smart Contracts

Rust can be useful for Lua bot smart contracts. It can help solve problems with memory constraints. If all bots were to be interpreted by a serialization process, the terminal can execute commands hidden from the user. This is local execution, and Rust comes with many terminal interface commands that can perform CRUD operations on the internet locally and still interface with the mainnet effectively.

## Software CPU Support

The OS can be supported by a software CPU that uses the MIPS architecture to run GoLang, Solidity, or Assembly to execute contract-like agreements where there is a full proof of execution that is untraceable to the client-side execution.

## Aleo as a Local Testnet Prover

Aleo can serve as a local testnet prover and print encrypted records on mainnet explorers or on Arweave Storage. This means we can have a zero-knowledge software CPU driving the execution of programs local to the client, compiling a proof of their operations (contract). This computation can create an output in a binary that can be run by anyone, as long as they have the proof. The proving network can pass the encrypted Binary, after a local or decentralized sequencer has transitioned the data binary into JSON format, and into the slots by command line arguments.
